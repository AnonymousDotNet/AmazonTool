# AmazonTool

AmazonTool is a developer-oriented tool for Amazon store API integration, aiming to help developers, operators, and testers efficiently manage store authorization, retrieve store data, generate permission keys, and facilitate API debugging. The project follows a modular, lightweight, and user-friendly design, supporting decoupled desktop clients and backend services for easy future expansion.

---

## 📝 Project Overview

Amazon’s API development and testing can be complex and time-consuming. AmazonTool aims to provide an all-in-one, low-barrier local assistant for individual developers and teams, making store authorization, API testing, and data management simple and efficient.

---

## 🚀 Core Feature Roadmap

- [ ] Store Authorization Integration: Quickly input and authorize Amazon store accounts.
- [ ] Retrieve Store Information: One-click fetch and visualization of store basic data.
- [ ] Permission Key Generation: Automatically generate API keys according to store information to simplify subsequent API calls.
- [ ] Persist Testing Data: Save input/output and history of API debugging/testing for traceability and reuse.

## ✨ Main Features

- Simple and intuitive desktop client (WinForm/WPF; both planned)
- Unified backend API service, easy to reuse on multiple clients
- Lightweight database persistence (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- Minimal configuration, ready to use
- Focus on "testing/debugging" scenarios, no need for full-blown integration

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend/Client**: WinForm (first), WPF (future), potential Web extension
- **Backend**: .NET API service, HTTP endpoints
- **Database**: SQLite preferred, PostgreSQL optional
- **Language**: C#
- **Tools**: Git, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code
